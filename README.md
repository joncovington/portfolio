## How it's built

### Server

Built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

### JS

Nothing too fancy. Manipulating a few elements using JQuery.


### CSS Framework

I'm a big fan of using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize CSS for rapid development.  
This portfolio was built using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) with some additional custom CSS.

### reCaptcha

[reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) is a free service from Google that helps protect websites from spam and abuse.  
I wanted to make sure my forms are protected from bots and abuse.

### Form processing

My contact form is processed by sending email via [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) api, and recorded using [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/).
